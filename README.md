# INSTRUCTIONS FOR TA's / INSTRUCTOR:

Hello! This is the repo for team #54. This is the root of the repo, ideally you don't end up here, but if so **here's how to find our assignments for grading**:
 - From the *root* of the repo (you are here) please select the folder labeled with the lab you wish to visit.
 - Within that, here's the important stuff:
     - in the `labx` directory, there will be (if appropriate) a report file, likely labeled as such regarding the lab, in a document file format (.odt, .doc, .pdf, .md, etc)
     - the `class` subfolder will contain the source material and all edited code
     - for a more complicated project, there will be a `README` file in that directory to help explain what everything is.
     - the rest is likely a variety of various files and folder created by Vivado. We'll try to keep this clean but Vivado gets unhappy sometimes.
  
Thanks!

# ABOUT THIS REPO
